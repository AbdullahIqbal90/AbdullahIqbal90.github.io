abstract: The current environmental and potable water crisis requires technological advancement to tackle the issues caused by different organic pollutants. Herein, we report the degradation of organic pollutants such as Congo Red and acetophenone from aqueous media using visible light irradiation. To harvest the solar energy for photocatalysis, we fabricated a nanohybrid system composed of bismuth ferrite nanoparticles with two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets, namely, the BiFeO3 (BFO)/Ti3C2 (MXene) nanohybrid, for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The hybrid BFO/MXene is fabricated using a simple and low-cost double-solvent solvothermal method. The SEM and TEM images showed that the BFO nanoparticles are attached onto the surface of 2D MXene sheets. The photocatalytic degradation achieved by the hybrid is found to be 100% in 42 min for the organic dye (Congo Red) and 100% for the colorless aqueous pollutant (acetophenone) in 150 min. The BFO/MXene hybrid system exhibited a large surface area of 147 m2 g–1 measured via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller sorption–desorption technique, which is found to be the largest among all BFO nanoparticles and derivatives. The photoluminescence spectra indicate a low electron–hole recombination rate. Fast and efficient degradation of organic molecules is caused by two factors, larger surface area and lower electron–hole recombination rate, which makes the BFO/MXene nanohybrid a highly efficient photocatalyst and a promising candidate for many future applications.

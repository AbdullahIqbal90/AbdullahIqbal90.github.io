Currently, I am a research assistant at PCSL Lab at [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](http://nust.edu.pk/Pages/Default.aspx/). 
I mainly research on the **chemical** **synthesis** **techniques** of nanomaterials and nanohybrids. Additionally, I focus on investigating the synthesized materials through different **characterization** **techniques** to find their *optical*, *structural* and *electrical properties*. 

I received my **MS** **in** **Physics** from [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](http://nust.edu.pk/Pages/Default.aspx/) and **BS** **in** **Physics** from [University of Gujrat](https://uog.edu.pk/main.php). I have synthesized **nanohybrids** that can be used to **degrade** the *organic* *dyes* and *colourless* *pollutants* from water in **short** **time** under **visible** **light**. I received **grant** from **Higher** **Education** **Commission** of Pakistan to pursue my Master studies at NUST. 
During my Bachelor studies I was awarded with **Most** **Dynamic** **Student** **of** **the** **Year** for my dynamic nature for pursuing studies along with *volunteer* *and* *community works*. During my job career as **Lecturer Physics** I was awarded with **Best** **Performer** **Award** for my mentored students **outperformed** **170** **colleges** in a competition on environmental projects exhibition in Islamabad.
